The webcomic series [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) by Randall Munroe is one of my favorite things on the internet. 
In his comics, the physicist Munroe jokes about science, math, and pop-culture.

Occasionally, the comics feature hand-drawn graphs, such as this one

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/front_door.png)

It's possible to create plots with the same style in R by using [xkcd](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xkcd/index.html), an addon package for the ggplot2 package.
The package can be installed from CRAN, additionally one needs to install an xkcd-style font, as described in the vignette of the package.

In this post I will visualize the "standard creepiness rule" of dating from this comic

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dating_pools.png)

First, let's write a function to get the upper and lower limit of dateable people for a certain age according to the rule
```{r}
## Standard creepiness range for a given age
standard_creepiness <- function(age) {
  lower <- age/2 + 7
  upper <- 2*(age - 7)
  data.frame(lower, upper)
}
```

Now, we can create a plot of the dating range using the usual ggplot2 functions. 
One way to make the lines look hand-drawn is to use jittering
```{r "creepyPlot1", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
## Libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(xkcd)

## Plot of creepiness range
age <- seq(14, 100, 1)
creepy_data <- data.frame(age, standard_creepiness(age))
creepy_plot <- ggplot(data = creepy_data, aes(x = age, y = age)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper, 
                  fill = "Standard non-creepiness range"), 
              alpha = 0.7, position = position_jitter(width = 0.2)) +
  geom_line(position = position_jitter(width = 0.3), size = 0.7, lty = 2) +
  labs(x = "Your age", y = "Partner age") + 
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Standard non-creepiness range" = "grey70")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 90, 15)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 90, 15))
```

Next comes the sugar from the xkcd package
```{r "creepyPlot2"}
creepy_plot +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 30, y = 90, 
           label = "Don't date under: \nage/2 + 7", 
           family = "xkcd", size = 5.8) +
  xkcdaxis(xrange = range(age), yrange = range(age)) +
  theme_xkcd()
```

I hope this post was useful to anyone else who spends weekends at home making graphs :)
